# Windsurf Rules for chinese-tutor project

## Always ensure that the chinese-tutor pyenv virtualenv is activated before running any commands

This ensures that all dependencies are available and commands run in the correct environment.

To activate the virtualenv, run:
  pyenv activate chinese-tutor

To check if the virtualenv is active, run:
  `python -c "import sys, os; print(sys.prefix);`

And if this says something with `chinese-tutor`, then the virtualenv is active.

If you haven't created this virtualenv yet, you can do so with:
  pyenv virtualenv 3.x.x chinese-tutor
  pyenv local chinese-tutor

Where 3.x.x is your preferred Python version.

## Always run `pre-commit` before declaring a feature as done

This ensures that all code is formatted and linted correctly before it is committed.

To check and fix code, run:
  pre-commit run --all-files
